## Abstract
Recent advances in reasoning language models and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have significantly enhanced multi-step reasoning capabilities. This progress motivates the extension of reasoning paradigms to remote sensing visual grounding task. However, existing remote sensing grounding methods remain largely confined to perception-level matching and single-entity formulations, limiting the role of explicit reasoning and inter-entity modeling. To address this challenge, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for Multi-Entity Reasoning Grounding in Remote Sensing (ME-RSRG). Based on ME-RSRG, we reformulate remote sensing grounding as a multi-entity reasoning task and propose an Entity-Aware Reasoning (EAR) framework built upon visual-linguistic foundation models. EAR generates structured reasoning traces and subject-object grounding outputs. It adopts supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization and is further optimized via entity-aware reward-driven Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments on ME-RSRG demonstrate the challenges of multi-entity reasoning and verify the effectiveness of our proposed EAR framework. Our dataset, code, and models will be available soon.

  <strong>(a) Matching-based visual grounding.</strong> Conventional approach focuses on aligning a single referring expression with one target subject.
  <strong>(b) Multi-entity reasoning grounding.</strong> Our proposed approach explicitly extracts multiple entities and produces structured reasoning-aware outputs for more interpretable understanding of complex remote sensing scenes.

### Dataset Production
ME-RSRG is constructed through a rigorous 5-step pipeline:
1. **Dataset Collection:** Collected from three benchmark RS visual grounding datasets: RSVG-HR, DIOR-RSVG, and OPT-RSVG.
2. **Instance Selection:** Used Gemini-2.5-Pro to filter expressions containing explicit subject-object structures and multiple entities.
3. **Manual Annotation:** Inherited original bounding box annotations and language descriptions, then identified and labeled corresponding object entities.
4. **Expert Assessment:** Domain experts conducted strict quality review of annotations.
5. **CoT Generation:** Generated reasoning traces for ~20% of the training set using Gemini-2.5-Pro.

### Dataset Analysis
- **Size:** 7,162 images and 12,091 image-text instances
- **Split:** 10,305 training instances (6,028 images) and 1,786 test instances (1,134 images)
- **CoT Annotations:** 2,149 training instances with explicit <think>...</think> reasoning tags
- **Challenges:** Large-scale spatial layouts, multi-entity ambiguity, and structured reasoning requirements

## Proposed Method: EAR Framework

    <figcaption>
  <strong>Overview of EAR framework.</strong> We adopt a two-stage optimization strategy. SFT is first applied as a cold-start initialization. With SFT-parameters loaded to policy model, entity-aware reward-driven GRPO is then employed to further refine the model.

### Entity-Aware Reward Model
The core component of EAR is an Entity-Aware Reward model consisting of three components:
1. **Two-level format reward:** Ensures structured reasoning and answer outputs.
2. **Entity-aware grounding accuracy reward:** Evaluates subject and object localization separately.
3. **Relational consistency reward:** Assesses the coherence of predicted inter-entity relations.

### Optimization Strategy
EAR adopts a two-stage optimization approach:
1. **Stage I: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Initializes the policy model with structured reasoning capability using CoT-annotated samples.
2. **Stage II: Entity-Aware Reward-Driven GRPO:** Refines the model through entity-aware rewards that explicitly evaluate grounding correctness for different entity roles.
